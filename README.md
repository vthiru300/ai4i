Models on the ai4i2020 dataset
•	Accurately classified machine failures in this predictive maintenance project using a suite of machine learning algorithms, including Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Trees. 
•	Each algorithm was trained and tested on a dataset containing a variety of industrial features, allowing us to compare their accuracy, recall, and precision.
